# Tesla Battery Range Calculator in React

### Getting started
* `yarn` To install all the dependencies for this Hackjam. If you don't have yarn installed, install it via `npm i yarn`
* `yarn start` To start the website locally.
* Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) To see the website running, full of bugs :)

### First things first

We've left a few bugs in the website, that you'll have to fix in order to understand the basic concepts of React

The index.js file is the entry point of the site, it is here that your first component is mounted and rendered.

### App.js

This is the first component mounted by React. Fix the errors in this file before moving :)

The logo seems to be missing, try to display it via the img tag

### Tesla Battery Component

This component is quite huge and buggy! You have to fix the templates errors before moving on, we introduced a few bugs there, find them and exterminate them!

There are also a few things not working in the methods :)

### After the component fix

If you managed to fix all the bugs in this component, you maybe noticed a few comments in the template. Try to break this huge component into smaller ones, following the comments :)

You'll have to play with the props and the and the local state

### Bonus

If you reached this point, congratulations!

See the state in the TeslaBatteryComponent? If you go on Tesla's website, you can grab real data and plug them into your app!

Too easy for you? Use Redux to manage the state of your app :)
